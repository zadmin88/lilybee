          So, let me take you on a little trip.
        </span>
        My love for all things creative blossomed in Colombia where I grew up,
        thanks to my incredible mom who nurtured my artistic spirit.
        <br />
        <br /> Fast forward, and I found myself married to the love of my life,
        a Marine officer. I moved to the US, and with his unwavering support, I
        learned English, went to school, and even became a dental hygienist!
        I&apos;m so grateful to my husband for always cheering me on, especially
        when we bought my first sewing machine and made my very own first pillow
        cover (Thank you, sweetheart, for always believing in my dreams!)
        <br />
        <br /> Speaking of creative bursts, when I was expecting my precious
        daughter, inspiration went into overdrive! I spent those pre-mom moments
        crafting beautiful things for her arrival. It was during this time,
        while lovingly making her blanket, that a tiny seed of a business idea
        sprouted.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then, on Christmas Eve, arrived the greatest gift of all – our precious
        daughter Lily Mia!
        <br />
        <br /> And so, in 2022, Lily Bee Gentle bloomed as a beautiful
        personalized blanket store on Etsy. My love for stunning fabrics led me
        down a new, exciting path – becoming a fabric designer! It was both
        magical and challenging, but I embraced it with open arms.
        <br />
        <br /> Today, I homeschool my little one and find endless inspiration in
        the beauty of Japan, all while creating precious memories with my
        family. And, of course, the journey continues with building our business
        from scratch!
        <br />
        <br />
        My mission is to share the joys of nature through my fabric collections,
        hoping to spark inspiration for your own creative projects.
