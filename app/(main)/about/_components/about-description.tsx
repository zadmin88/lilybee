      My love affair with crafts blossomed in Colombia, at five years old, when
      my mama gifted me my first needle and thread. Magic danced in every
      stitch, and now, it&apos;s my turn to pass that magic spark to Lily Mia!
      <br />

      Life took a wild turn when I met my husband. I moved to US, learned
      English, conquered dental hygiene school, and somehow still managed to
      squeeze in some creative time. Thanks for always believing in me, honey!
      Remember that first sewing machine? A treasured memory, along with that
      wonky-but-adorable pillow cover I made.
      <br />
      <br /> Then came the greatest gift of all: Lily Mia, born on Christmas Eve
      like a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on our lives. While pregnant, I made her
      endless handmade treasures, and guess what? Lily Bee Gentle was born!
      <br />
      <br />
      It started as a cozy blanket haven on Etsy, but then, like a bolt of
      inspiration, my world expanded.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now, I&apos;m homeschooling my little explorer, building a beautiful
      family, and crafting a fabric empire from scratch. My mission? To empower
      YOU, fellow makers, to create your own handmade masterpieces with my
      collections! Can&apos;t wait to see the magic you create!
